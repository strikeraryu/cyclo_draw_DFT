1. setup
    It doesn't require much setup you just need to install python or you can run the executable file

2. how to use
    There is a default drawing so you can simply run cyclo_draw_v2.exe/cyclo_draw_v2.py, 
    if you want to use your own drawing you have to run draw.py/draw.exe and draw a closed figured drawing if you close
    the program the drawing is automatically saved now you can run cyclo_draw_v2.exe/cyclo_draw_v2.py 

3. Settings
    There are different properties you can change in the program
    skip - to skip the points of the drawing (more points will increase the quality and time)
    mg - for the magnification of the image
    vis - to visualize the circles
    move - to move the background (i.e to draw the wave format)

!! you can run the cyclo_draw.exe/cyclo_draw_v2.py in place of cyclo_draw_v2 to get different epicycles for different axis !!
!! runnig exe can file can take sometime !!
